*findMinCost uses Least() and Add() to maintain the
    list of live nodes

    Least() finds a live node with least cost,
    deletes
        it from the list and returns it

        Add(x) calculates cost of x and adds it to the list
        of live nodes

        Implements list of live nodes as a min heap * /

        // Search Space Tree Node
        node
{
    int job_number;
    int worker_number;
    node parent;
    int cost;
}

// Input: Cost Matrix of Job Assignment problem
// Output: Optimal cost and Assignment of Jobs
algorithm findMinCost(costMatrix mat[][])
{
    // Initialize list of live nodes(min-Heap)
    // with root of search tree i.e. a Dummy node
    while (true)
    {
        // Find a live node with least estimated cost
        E = Least();

        // The found node is deleted from the list
        // of live nodes
        if (E is a leaf node)
        {
            printSolution();
            return;
        }

     for each
         child x of E
         {
             Add(x);        // Add x to list of live nodes;
             x->parent = E; // Pointer for path to root
         }
    }
}
